# GCYL: CEu

## Currently in alpha. A survival play through is impossible and not supported. Find breaks in progression, overlapping recipes, missing recipes, useless recipes, etc. and submit problems and suggestions with GitHub issues.
### Recipes that have missing items and are like "holes" (see assline screenshots in issue #3) do not need to be reported as these are easy to fix.


Gregicality Legacy Port to CEu (specifically with reference to the Technological Journey fork)

Requires latest versions of Gregtech: CEu, Gregicality Multiblocks, Material Replication, and GroovyScript and their dependencies to run.
